# The Tunel Interface
Tunel is all about its interface. We aren't professional web designers, but we
value simplicity of design. The first point of interaction is a table that
shows your containers.

When you click `pull` you are taken to a page where you can pull containers 
from different endpoints! This will eventually include all
the endpoints that [Singularity Global Client](https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/clients)
supports, and for now is your bread and butter endpoints.

The settings panel will help to manage tokens which, if you map the database to 
your computer, will only persist there.

Also in development is an interface to make it much easier to generate recipes.
