# Tunel

This is the Tunel, giving you interactive management for your containers. 

![docs/img/tunel.png](docs/img/tunel.png)

The interface provides interactive pulling, recipe generation, and management for 
Singularity containers managed by a [Singularity Global Client](https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli).
However, you don't need to actually install the client locally because the entire thing
is packaged in a Docker container.
