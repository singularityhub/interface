You should download / pull / build your singularity images here, with names that are reasonable for a web browser to access. Eg:

      
         singularity pull shub://vsoch/singularity-images
        

will pull vsoch-singularity-images-mongo.img (using version 2.3 of Singularity, the current lib-refactor branch.)
